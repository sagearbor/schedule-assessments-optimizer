# Schedule of Assessments (SoA) Optimizer - Production Ready

## 🎉 Project Status: PRODUCTION READY WITH REAL MCP INTEGRATION

The application is fully functional with real MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration, aggressive optimization engine, and visual bar chart comparisons. The system now produces highly visible optimization improvements.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: External MCP Server Dependency

The Schedule Optimizer requires the **real MCP server** to be running for full functionality.
This is an **external service** that must be started BEFORE running the Schedule Optimizer.

### Step 1: Start the MCP Server (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Navigate to the MCP tools repository
cd /dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/dcri-mcp-tools

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the MCP server (runs on port 8210)
python server.py

# Leave this running in the background or separate terminal
```

### Step 2: Start the Schedule Optimizer

```bash
# In a new terminal, navigate to schedule optimizer
cd /dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/schedule-assessments-optimizer

# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build -d

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3040
# Backend API: http://localhost:8040
# MCP Server: http://localhost:8210 (external dependency)
```

### Verify MCP Server is Running

```bash
# Test MCP server connectivity
curl http://localhost:8210/health

# Or run the test script
python test_mcp_integration.py
```

### Docker Management Commands

```bash
# Check status of running containers
docker compose ps

# Stop and remove all containers (clean shutdown)
docker compose down

# Rebuild and start all services (use when code changes or ports are stale)
docker compose up --build -d

# Restart services without rebuilding (if no code changes)
docker compose restart

# Stop services without removing containers
docker compose stop

# Start previously stopped services
docker compose start

# View logs for all services
docker compose logs

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs backend
# Note: Mock MCP services have been replaced with real MCP server

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f

# Remove all containers and volumes (complete cleanup)
docker compose down -v
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Install and run frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 📊 Sample Data

The application includes realistic clinical trial data for three therapeutic areas:

1. **Oncology Phase 2**: 10 visits over 150 days with imaging, biopsies, and PK sampling
2. **Cardiology Phase 3**: 6 visits over 365 days focused on safety monitoring
3. **Neurology Phase 2**: 6 visits over 180 days with cognitive assessments and MRI
4. **Complex Demo**: 19 visits with many optimization opportunities
   - Shows visible changes: 19→18 visits
   - Baseline elimination: 4→0 assessments
   - Visit consolidation: Day 3 + Day 5 merged
