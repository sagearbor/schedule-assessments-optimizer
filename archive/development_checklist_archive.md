### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Local Environment (Sprint 1) - COMPLETED

**Objective:** Establish the project structure and a fully containerized local environment using Docker Compose.

- [x] **Project Scaffolding**
    - [x] Initialize Git repository: `schedule-assessments-optimizer`.
    - [x] Create the primary directory structure:
      ```
      schedule-assessments-optimizer/
      ├── backend/         # Main FastAPI application
      ├── services/
      │   ├── mcp_ProtocolComplexityAnalyzer/
      │   └── mcp_ComplianceKnowledgeBase/
      ├── frontend/
      ├── docker-compose.yml
      └── README.md
      ```
- [x] **Data Modeling**
    - [x] Define the core Pydantic models in `backend/models.py` for:
        - `Assessment`: (e.g., name, duration, cost, is_invasive, equipment_needed)
        - `Visit`: (e.g., name, day, list of Assessments)
        - `Schedule`: (e.g., list of Visits)
        - `OptimizationResult`: (e.g., original_schedule, suggested_schedule, burden_scores, warnings)
- [x] **Containerization Setup**
    - [x] Create `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` for the `backend` and each mock `service`.
    - [x] Write `docker-compose.yml` to define and network the `backend`, the two mock MCP `services`, and the `frontend`. Expose the backend API on port 8080.
- [x] **Mock MCP Services**
    - [x] Build simple FastAPI mock servers for `ProtocolComplexityAnalyzer` and `ComplianceKnowledgeBase`. They should accept a `Schedule` object and return mock data (e.g., complexity scores, compliance warnings).
    - [x] Write a basic `pytest` for each mock service to ensure it starts and returns the expected mock data.

### Phase 2: Backend - The Optimization Engine (Sprints 2-3) - COMPLETED

**Objective:** Develop the core logic of the application. This "Rules Engine" will analyze schedules and generate optimization suggestions.

- [x] **Burden Calculation Module (`backend/burden_calculator.py`)**
    - [x] Create a function to calculate a **Patient Burden Score** from a `Schedule` object (e.g., sum of visit durations, count of invasive procedures).
    - [x] Create a function to calculate a **Site Burden Score** (e.g., sum of staff time, unique equipment requirements).
    - [x] Write `pytest` unit tests for these functions with mocked `Schedule` data to verify scoring accuracy.
- [x] **Rules Engine Development (`backend/rules_engine.py`)**
    - [x] Implement the first rule: **Redundancy Detection**. Identify and flag assessments that are repeated within a short timeframe without clear justification.
    - [x] Implement the second rule: **Visit Consolidation**. Identify visits that are close together in time with low patient burden, and suggest merging them.
    - [x] Implement the third rule: **Logistical Feasibility**. Cross-reference with the `ComplianceKnowledgeBase` MCP to flag impossible schedules (e.g., a procedure scheduled on a weekend when a lab is closed).
    - [x] Write extensive `pytest` unit tests for each rule, providing various `Schedule` objects to confirm the rule logic is sound.
- [x] **Main API Endpoint (`backend/main.py`)**
    - [x] Create the primary endpoint: `POST /optimize-schedule`.
    - [x] This endpoint should:
        1. Accept a `Schedule` object in the request body.
        2. Call the `Burden Calculator` to get the baseline score.
        3. Pass the schedule through the `Rules Engine`.
        4. Call the mock MCPs for additional context.
        5. Assemble and return an `OptimizationResult` object.
    - [x] Write `pytest` integration tests for this endpoint, mocking the `httpx` calls to the MCP services.

### Phase 3: Frontend - The User Interface (Sprints 3-4) - COMPLETED

**Objective:** Design and build an intuitive interface for study designers to upload, visualize, and compare schedules.

- [x] **Wireframing & UI Design**
    - [x] Design a three-part UI:
        1. **Input:** A simple interface for uploading a CSV/JSON file or manually building a schedule.
        2. **Dashboard:** A view to display the analysis of the *current* schedule, showing burden scores and warnings.
        3. **Comparison View:** A side-by-side display of the original schedule and the *optimized* version, highlighting the changes and improvements.
- [x] **Component Development**
    - [x] Build a reusable `ScheduleTable` component that can visually render a `Schedule` object.
    - [x] Build the `FileUpload` and manual entry components.
    - [x] Build the `BurdenScoreCard` and `WarningsList` components for the dashboard.
- [x] **State Management & API Connection**
    - [x] Implement frontend state management to handle the original schedule, the analysis results, and the optimized schedule.
    - [x] Connect the UI to the backend API. When a user submits a schedule, call `POST /optimize-schedule` and update the UI with the response.
    - [x] Implement clear loading and error states for the user.

### Phase 4: Integration, Testing, & Deployment (Sprint 5) - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**Objective:** Ensure all parts of the application work together seamlessly and prepare for deployment.

- [x] **End-to-End Testing**
    - [x] Run the entire application locally using `docker-compose up`.
    - [x] Perform manual end-to-end tests: Upload a complex schedule, verify the optimization results on the frontend, and confirm the logic matches expectations.
- [x] **Finalization & Documentation**
    - [x] Refine the UI based on internal feedback.
    - [x] Document the API endpoints and the data models.
- [ ] **"Stitching to Azure" - Deployment Plan** (PENDING - Awaiting Azure permissions)
    - [ ] Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store Docker images.
    - [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically build, test, and push images to ACR.
    - [ ] Provision Azure App Services for the backend, frontend, and mock services, configuring them to pull their respective images from ACR.

## Notes

The application currently uses REST API services that mimic MCP functionality. The next phase will involve converting these to true MCP protocol servers using stdio/JSON-RPC communication as documented in the main development_checklist.md.
